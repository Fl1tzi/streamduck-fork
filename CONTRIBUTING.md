External help with the project is more than welcome, after all a single developer can't always provide best solutions to the problems of the project. If you want to contribute to the project, here's how you get started
## Consider if your contribution could be a plugin instead
This project is set to be the foundation, it will have the most essential features that require the project to function properly. 

If you want to contribute to this project to solve some problem you found while using the software, then go ahead. If you want to contribute a feature (like integrations with services, better macro tools, better folders and etc), consider creating a plugin. Documentation for creating plugins can be found on [the docs site](https://docs.streamduck.org)

Plugins will have a separate highlight page on the Streamduck site, so people could learn about your plugin!

## Getting started
1. Make sure you have Rust toolchain installed, you can install it with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Make sure to [install dependencies](https://docs.streamduck.org/install.html#dependencies) if you're on Linux
3. Fork the project and create a new branch

Main branch will be kept safe to ensure the branch will always have the most working version of the project

3. Check the documentation as it should explain a bit of how everything works. The code is hopefully also self-explanatory
4. Make your change and make sure it builds

With Rust it's at least easier to make sure the code works, because if it compiles, it will probably work

5. Commit your changes

With the commit messages, try to briefly explain what you did

6. Create your pull request to `dev` branch and basically explain what you're contributing

At this point, I'll check your pull request and possibly after a couple of requested changes, I'll merge your change if I like it
